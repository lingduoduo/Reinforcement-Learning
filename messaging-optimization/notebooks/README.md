## Production / experimental notebooks

#### Tensorflow Data Validation for UP.ipynb
this is the template used by ```hchudgar@``` for exploring what we can do and how we can benefit from Tensorflow Data Validation toolkit

#### schema\_domains.ipynb
this is the notebook originally designed by ```slayton@``` during building the feature importance 
pipeline. this should be a production notebook that generates plausible schemas with expected 
domains for features such that we can use schema file for serving ML feature outlier detection. the 
domains of feature values should be designed by ML engineers and backend engineers together

#### FeatureCorrelation.ipynb
this is the notebook used by ```hchudgar@``` to calculate the feature 
correlation with particular labels we are predicting. this is useful to understand the 
predictability of our labels with our features at least in a linear kind model setup

#### EmailTemplates.ipynb
the notebook ```hchudgar@``` used to start the email template exploration. it contains some basic 
operations on the template data e.g. extracting some structured data from the
 unstructured templates

#### EmailTemplatesNLP.ipynb
this is the notebook used by ```shuoy@``` for some initial efforts to build the ML-infra and 
explore for bringing in content NLP features into the existing pipeline. the stuff 
inside might be useful or not useful at all, since mostly they are just some personal and initial 
thoughts

#### Exploring Push templates.ipynb
Explores word statistics in push templates to answer questions related to word variety, how much textual information is present and how templates are parameterized.
